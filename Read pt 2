## Hi, yes I did manage to get it working. I'll post two examples in this, the interaction file and an example command.
## With the interactionCreate.js file, the code I have has the default cooldown to 3 seconds, even if you don't have it in the command code.


## I also figured it out as well. it was weird. Thank you though! if you want to add me on discord its the same username!
